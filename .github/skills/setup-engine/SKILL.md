description: "Configure the project's game engine and version. Records the engine in the workspace's chosen project-context file, detects knowledge gaps, and populates engine reference docs when the version is beyond the LLM's training data."
argument-hint: "[engine] | [engine version] | refresh | upgrade [old-version] [new-version] | no args for guided selection"
user-invocable: true
---

When this skill is invoked:

## 1. Parse Arguments

Four modes:

- **Full spec**: `/setup-engine godot 4.6` — engine and version provided
- **Version only**: `/setup-engine 4.6` — Godot version provided directly
- **No args**: `/setup-engine` — fully guided Godot setup (version + language + defaults)
- **Refresh**: `/setup-engine refresh` — update reference docs (see Section 10)
- **Upgrade**: `/setup-engine upgrade [old-version] [new-version]` — migrate to a new engine version (see Section 11)

If the first argument is `godot`, treat any second argument as the requested version.
If the first argument looks like a version number, treat it as `godot [version]`.

---

## 2. Guided Mode (No Arguments)

If no version is specified, run a Godot-first setup flow:

### Check for existing game concept
- Read `design/gdd/game-concept.md` if it exists — extract genre, scope, platform
   targets, art style, team size, and any pinned Godot recommendation from `/brainstorm`
- If no concept exists, inform the user:
  > "No game concept found. Consider running `/brainstorm` first to discover what
   > you want to build. Or tell me about your game and I can help you choose a
   > Godot version, language, and default constraints."

### Ask in this order:

**Question 1 — Target platform** (ask first, always, via `AskUserQuestion`):
- Prompt: "What platforms are you targeting for this game?"
- Options: `PC (Steam / Epic)` / `Mobile (iOS / Android)` / `Console` / `Web / Browser` / `Multiple platforms`
- Record the answer — it drives export presets, performance budgets, and input defaults.

**Question 2 — Rendering scope**:
- Prompt: "What rendering scope fits this project best?"
- Options: `2D` / `Stylized 3D` / `Mixed 2D and 3D` / `Not sure yet`
- Use this to frame shader complexity, scene composition, and asset pipeline defaults.

**Question 3 — Language preference**:
- Prompt: "Which Godot language setup do you want to optimize for?"
- Options: `GDScript` / `C#` / `Both` / `Need guidance`
- If they need guidance, resolve it in Section 4 before editing any files.

**Question 4 — Version strategy**:
- Prompt: "Should I pin the latest stable Godot, or a specific version you already use?"
- Options: `Latest stable` / `I already have a version in mind` / `Need advice from the concept`
- If they already have a version, record it. If they need advice, recommend the latest stable unless a dependency or platform constraint says otherwise.

### Produce a Godot setup recommendation

Do NOT turn this into a multi-engine comparison. The goal is to pin a Godot setup that fits the project's constraints.

Present:
- The recommended Godot version strategy (latest stable vs explicitly pinned version)
- The recommended language choice with tradeoffs for this project
- The main platform constraints to keep in mind (mobile/web/console/performance)
- A short note that this is a starting configuration, not an irreversible choice

Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:
- `[Recommended setup]`
- `Adjust the version`
- `Adjust the language`
- `Adjust both`
- `Type something`

If the user wants to go deeper, answer concept-specific questions about Godot constraints: scene streaming, input stack, rendering pipeline, memory budgets, platform exports, or language boundaries.

---

## 3. Look Up Current Version

Once the engine is chosen:

- If version was provided, use it
- If no version provided, use WebSearch to find the latest stable release:
  - Search: `"[engine] latest stable version [current year]"`
  - Confirm with the user: "The latest stable [engine] is [version]. Use this?"

---

## 4. Update the Workspace Engine Record

### Language Selection (Godot only)

If Godot was chosen, ask the user which language to use **before** showing the proposed Technology Stack:

> "Godot supports two primary languages:
>
>   **A) GDScript** — Python-like, Godot-native, fastest iteration. Best for beginners, solo devs, and teams coming from Python or Lua.
>   **B) C#** — .NET 8+, stronger IDE tooling, better fit for teams already standardized on C#, and a slight performance advantage on heavy logic.
>   **C) Both** — GDScript for gameplay/UI scripting, C# for performance-critical systems. Advanced setup — requires .NET SDK alongside Godot.
>
> Which will this project primarily use?"

Record the choice. It determines the workspace engine record, naming conventions, specialist routing, and which agent is spawned for code files throughout the project.

---

Read the current workspace contract files and show the user the proposed engine-record changes.
Ask: "May I write these engine settings to the chosen project-context file?"

Wait for confirmation before making any edits.

Update the Technology Stack section, replacing the `[CHOOSE]` placeholders with the actual values using the Godot template that matches the selected language. See **Appendix A** at the bottom of this skill for the GDScript, C#, and mixed-language variants.

---

## 5. Populate Project Technical Preferences

After updating the workspace's chosen engine record, capture the same preferences in a user-approved project-local preferences file. This workspace does not ship with a default technical-preferences path. Read any existing project-local template first, then fill in:

### Engine & Language Section
- Fill from the engine choice made in step 4

### Naming Conventions (engine defaults)

Use the matching Godot naming conventions from **Appendix A**:
- `A2` for GDScript projects
- `A2` C# variant for C# projects
- `A2` mixed-language guidance when both languages are in use

### Input & Platform Section

Populate `## Input & Platform` using the answers gathered in Section 2 (or extracted
from the game concept). Derive the values using this mapping:

| Platform target | Gamepad Support | Touch Support |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| PC only | Partial (recommended) | None |
| Console | Full | None |
| Mobile | None | Full |
| PC + Console | Full | None |
| PC + Mobile | Partial | Full |
| Web | Partial | Partial |

For **Primary Input**, use the dominant input for the game genre:
- Action/RPG/platformer targeting console → Gamepad
- Strategy/point-and-click/RTS → Keyboard/Mouse
- Mobile game → Touch
- Cross-platform → ask the user

Present the derived values and ask the user to confirm or adjust before writing.

Example filled section:
```markdown
## Input & Platform
- **Target Platforms**: PC, Console
- **Input Methods**: Keyboard/Mouse, Gamepad
- **Primary Input**: Gamepad
- **Gamepad Support**: Full
- **Touch Support**: None
- **Platform Notes**: All UI must support d-pad navigation. No hover-only interactions.
```

### Remaining Sections
- **Performance Budgets**: Use `AskUserQuestion`:
  - Prompt: "Should I set default performance budgets now, or leave them for later?"
  - Options: `[A] Set defaults now (60fps, 16.6ms frame budget, engine-appropriate draw call limit)` / `[B] Leave as [TO BE CONFIGURED] — I'll set these when I know my target hardware`
  - If [A]: populate with the suggested defaults. If [B]: leave as placeholder.
- **Testing**: Suggest a Godot-appropriate framework (GdUnit4 or GUT) — ask before adding.
- **Forbidden Patterns**: Leave as placeholder — do NOT pre-populate.
- **Allowed Libraries**: Leave as placeholder — do NOT pre-populate dependencies the project does not currently need. Only add a library here when it is actively being integrated, not speculatively.

> **Guardrail**: Never add speculative dependencies to Allowed Libraries. For example, do NOT add GodotSteam unless Steam integration is actively beginning in this session. Post-launch integrations should be added to Allowed Libraries when that work begins, not during engine setup.

### Engine Specialists Routing

Also populate the `## Engine Specialists` section in that project-local preferences file using the Godot routing table from **Appendix A**. Pick the GDScript, C#, or mixed-language variant that matches the language choice from Section 4.

### Collaborative Step
Present the filled-in preferences to the user. For Godot, include the chosen language and note where the full naming conventions and routing tables live:
> "Here are the default technical preferences for [engine] ([language if Godot]). The naming conventions and specialist routing are in Appendix A of this skill — I'll apply the [GDScript/C#/Both] variant. Want to customize any of these, or shall I save the defaults?"

For all other engines, present the defaults directly without referencing the appendix.

Wait for approval before writing the file.

---

## 6. Determine Knowledge Gap

Check whether the engine version is likely beyond the LLM's training data.

**Known approximate coverage** (update this as models change):
- LLM knowledge cutoff: **May 2025**
- Godot: training data likely covers up to ~4.3

Compare the user's chosen version against these baselines:

- **Within training data** → `LOW RISK` — reference docs optional but recommended
- **Near the edge** → `MEDIUM RISK` — reference docs recommended
- **Beyond training data** → `HIGH RISK` — reference docs required

Inform the user which category they're in and why.

---

## 7. Populate Engine Reference Docs

### If WITHIN training data (LOW RISK):

Create a minimal `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`:

```markdown
# [Engine] — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Engine Version** | [version] |
| **Project Pinned** | [today's date] |
| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | LOW — version is within LLM training data |

## Note

This engine version is within the LLM's training data. Engine reference
docs are optional but can be added later if agents suggest incorrect APIs.

Run `/setup-engine refresh` to populate full reference docs at any time.
```

Do NOT create breaking-changes.md, deprecated-apis.md, etc. — they would
add context cost with minimal value.

### If BEYOND training data (MEDIUM or HIGH RISK):

Create the full reference doc set by searching the web:

1. **Search for the official migration/upgrade guide**:
   - `"[engine] [old version] to [new version] migration guide"`
   - `"[engine] [version] breaking changes"`
   - `"[engine] [version] changelog"`
   - `"[engine] [version] deprecated API"`

2. **Fetch and extract** from official documentation:
   - Breaking changes between each version from the training cutoff to current
   - Deprecated APIs with replacements
   - New features and best practices

Ask: "May I create the engine reference docs under `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/`?"

Wait for confirmation before writing any files.

3. **Create the full reference directory**:
   ```
   docs/engine-reference/<engine>/
   ├── VERSION.md              # Version pin + knowledge gap analysis
   ├── breaking-changes.md     # Version-by-version breaking changes
   ├── deprecated-apis.md      # "Don't use X → Use Y" tables
   ├── current-best-practices.md  # New practices since training cutoff
   └── modules/                # Per-subsystem references (create as needed)
   ```

4. **Populate each file** using real data from the web searches, following
   the format established in existing reference docs. Every file must have
   a "Last verified: [date]" header.

5. **For module files**: Only create modules for subsystems where significant
   changes occurred. Don't create empty or minimal module files.

---

## 8. Update the Project-Context Import

Ask: "May I update the relevant import in the chosen project-context file to point to the new engine reference?"

Wait for confirmation, then update the `@` import under "Engine Version Reference" to point to the
correct engine:

```markdown
## Engine Version Reference

@docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md
```

If the previous import pointed to a different engine (e.g., switching from
another reference path), update it.

---

## 9. Update Agent Instructions

Ask: "May I add a Version Awareness section to the engine specialist agent files?" before making any edits.

For the chosen engine's specialist agents, verify they have a
"Version Awareness" section. If not, add one following the pattern in
the existing Godot specialist agents.

The section should instruct the agent to:
1. Read `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`
2. Check deprecated APIs before suggesting code
3. Check breaking changes for relevant version transitions
4. Use WebSearch to verify uncertain APIs

---

## 10. Refresh Subcommand

If invoked as `/setup-engine refresh`:

1. Read the existing `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md` to get
   the current engine and version
2. Use WebSearch to check for:
   - New engine releases since last verification
   - Updated migration guides
   - Newly deprecated APIs
3. Update all reference docs with new findings
4. Update "Last verified" dates on all modified files
5. Report what changed

---

## 11. Upgrade Subcommand

If invoked as `/setup-engine upgrade [old-version] [new-version]`:

### Step 1 — Read Current Version State

Read `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md` to confirm the current pinned
version, risk level, and any migration note URLs already recorded. If
`old-version` was not provided as an argument, use the pinned version from this
file.

### Step 2 — Fetch Migration Guide

Use WebSearch and WebFetch to locate the official migration guide between
`old-version` and `new-version`:

- Search: `"[engine] [old-version] to [new-version] migration guide"`
- Search: `"[engine] [new-version] breaking changes changelog"`
- Fetch the migration guide URL from VERSION.md if one is already recorded,
  or use the URL found via search.

Extract: renamed APIs, removed APIs, changed defaults, behavior changes, and
any "must migrate" items.

### Step 3 — Pre-Upgrade Audit

Scan `src/` for code that uses APIs known to be deprecated or changed in the
target version:

- Use Grep to search for deprecated API names extracted from the migration
  guide (e.g., old function names, removed node types, changed property names)
- List each file that matches, with the specific API reference found

Present the audit results as a table:

```
Pre-Upgrade Audit: [engine] [old-version] → [new-version]
==========================================================

Files requiring changes:
  File                              | Deprecated API Found       | Effort
  --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------
  src/gameplay/player_movement.gd   | old_api_name               | Low
  src/ui/hud.gd                     | removed_node_type          | Medium

Breaking changes to watch for:
  - [change description from migration guide]
  - [change description from migration guide]

Recommended migration order (dependency-sorted):
  1. [system/layer with fewest dependencies first]
  2. [next system]
  ...
```

If no deprecated APIs are found in `src/`, report: "No deprecated API usage
found in src/ — upgrade may be low-risk."

### Step 4 — Confirm Before Updating

Ask the user before making any changes:

> "Pre-upgrade audit complete. Found [N] files using deprecated APIs.
> Proceed with upgrading VERSION.md to [new-version]?
> (This will update the pinned version and add migration notes — it does NOT
> change any source files. Source migration is done manually or via stories.)"

Wait for explicit confirmation before continuing.

### Step 5 — Update VERSION.md

After confirmation:

1. Update `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`:
   - `Engine Version` → `[new-version]`
   - `Project Pinned` → today's date
   - `Last Docs Verified` → today's date
   - Re-evaluate and update the `Risk Level` and `Post-Cutoff Version Timeline`
     table if the new version falls beyond the LLM knowledge cutoff
   - Add a `## Migration Notes — [old-version] → [new-version]` section
     containing: migration guide URL, key breaking changes, deprecated APIs
     found in this project, and recommended migration order from the audit

2. If `breaking-changes.md` or `deprecated-apis.md` exist in the engine
   reference directory, append the new version's changes to those files.

### Step 6 — Post-Upgrade Reminder

After updating VERSION.md, output:

```
VERSION.md updated: [engine] [old-version] → [new-version]

Next steps:
1. Migrate deprecated API usages in the [N] files listed above
2. Run /setup-engine refresh after upgrading the actual engine binary to
   verify no new deprecations were missed
3. Run /architecture-review — the engine upgrade may invalidate ADRs that
   reference specific APIs or engine capabilities
4. If any ADRs are invalidated, run /propagate-design-change to update
   downstream stories
```

---

## 12. Output Summary

After setup is complete, output:

```
Engine Setup Complete
=====================
Engine:          [name] [version]
Language:        [GDScript | C# | GDScript + C#]
Knowledge Risk:  [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
Reference Docs:  [created/skipped]
Project context:  [updated]
Tech Prefs:      [created/updated]
Agent Config:    [verified]

Next Steps:
1. Review docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md
2. [If from /brainstorm] Run /map-systems to decompose your concept into individual systems
3. [If from /brainstorm] Run /design-system to author per-system GDDs (guided, section-by-section)
4. [If from /brainstorm] Run /prototype [core-mechanic] to test the core loop
5. [If fresh start] Run /brainstorm to discover your game concept
6. Create your first milestone: /sprint-plan new
```

---

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — engine configured and reference docs populated.

## Guardrails

- NEVER guess an engine version — always verify via WebSearch or user confirmation
- NEVER overwrite existing reference docs without asking — append or update
- If reference docs already exist for a different engine, ask before replacing
- Always show the user what you're about to change before making project-context edits
- If WebSearch returns ambiguous results, show the user and let them decide
- When the user chose **GDScript**: copy the GDScript workspace engine-record template from Appendix A1 exactly. NEVER add "C++ via GDExtension" to the Language field. GDScript projects may use GDExtension, but it is not a primary project language. The `godot-gdextension-specialist` in the routing table is available for when native extensions are needed — it does not make C++ a project language.

---

## Appendix A — Godot Language Configuration

All Godot-specific variants for language-dependent configuration. Referenced from Sections 4 and 5 — only relevant when Godot is the chosen engine. Use the subsection matching the language chosen in Section 4.

---

### A1. Workspace Engine Record Templates

**GDScript:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Build System**: SCons (engine), Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

> **Guardrail**: When using this GDScript template, write the Language field as exactly "`GDScript`" — no additions. Do NOT append "C++ via GDExtension" or any other language. The C# template below includes GDExtension because C# projects commonly wrap native code; GDScript projects do not.

**C#:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: C# (.NET 8+, primary), C++ via GDExtension (native plugins only)
- **Build System**: .NET SDK + Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

**Both — GDScript + C#:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: GDScript (gameplay/UI scripting), C# (performance-critical systems), C++ via GDExtension (native only)
- **Build System**: .NET SDK + Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

---

### A2. Naming Conventions

**GDScript:**
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- Variables/functions: snake_case (e.g., `move_speed`)
- Signals: snake_case past tense (e.g., `health_changed`)
- Files: snake_case matching class (e.g., `player_controller.gd`)
- Scenes: PascalCase matching root node (e.g., `PlayerController.tscn`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)

**C#:**
- Classes: PascalCase (`PlayerController`) — must also be `partial`
- Public properties/fields: PascalCase (`MoveSpeed`, `JumpVelocity`)
- Private fields: `_camelCase` (`_currentHealth`, `_isGrounded`)
- Methods: PascalCase (`TakeDamage()`, `GetCurrentHealth()`)
- Signal delegates: PascalCase + `EventHandler` suffix (`HealthChangedEventHandler`)
- Files: PascalCase matching class (`PlayerController.cs`)
- Scenes: PascalCase matching root node (`PlayerController.tscn`)
- Constants: PascalCase (`MaxHealth`, `DefaultMoveSpeed`)

**Both — GDScript + C#:**
Use GDScript conventions for `.gd` files and C# conventions for `.cs` files. Mixed-language files do not exist — the boundary is per-file. When in doubt about which language a new system should use, ask the user and record the decision in that project-local preferences file.

---

### A3. Engine Specialists Routing

**GDScript:**
```markdown
## Engine Specialists
- **Primary**: godot-specialist
- **Language/Code Specialist**: godot-gdscript-specialist (all .gd files)
